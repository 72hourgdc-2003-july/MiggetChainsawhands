          Migget Chainsaw Hands
              Readme.rtf


    Executing:
      After extracting to your desired folder, you can play Migget Chainsaw Hands by
    running the file "Migget.exe."

    Controls:
      Your character (Migget) can be controlled using the Left/Right arrow keys to move
    either left or right and Up to jump.  Pressing Control will make Migget attack, while pressing
    Alt will do a special attack, depending on the current special level (see below).  Other buttons
    and their functions include P to pause or unpause the game, Escape to exit the game, F11 
    to show the current framerate, and F12 to take a screenshot.
     
    Goal:
      The goal of the game is to defeat as many enemies as you can.  To help Migget with
    this, are items dropped by the enemies Migget kills.  These items include a extra dose of 
    health, an extra life, and special pills.

    Special and Special Pills:
      When Migget collects special pills from someone he has defeated, Migget's Special
    Level increases.  When his Special Level is high enough, one of the purple orbs on the 
    bottom of the screen will appear with an X.  At this point Migget can do a Speical Attack by
    pressing the Alt key.  Though by doing this most or all of Migget's Special Level will be 
    depleted, he will release a Special Attack.  When two X's are present, Migget will do another
    more powerful attack.  If though Migget tries use a Special Attack when there are no X's in 
    the orbs, than he will do a regular attack.  Find out the details behind each Special Attack 
    by collecting enough pills to try out each one.

    Goal:
      Every time Migget kills an enemy, your score increases.  If you notice the light in
    the bottom right corner become lit, then you have beaten the current high score.  Pressing
    Escape or running out of lives at this point will record your high score the next time you play.

    Story:
      Migget was captured from his homeworld and taken to the laboratories of the evil cyborg Oradicators.  There they tried to transform him into a gladiator slave, warping his mind and replacing his hands with with brutal chainsaws.  But Migget rebelled against their experiments and broke free.  Now trapped on the surface of this alien world, Migget battles on, driven by his lust for vengence and the powerful stimulants stolen from the cyborgs.  Though he knows it's only a matter of time before he is overpowered by the endless Oradicator legions, he will not go down without a fight.

    Troubleshooting:
      If you find you're having a sluggish framerate, try lowering the colour to 24-bit by opening up the config.exe file in the root directory.  Select sphere_gl.dll and then configure driver.  Select 2x, 24-bit color, and leave the rest blank.  If the game crashes for no reason or doesn't start up, try switching the display drivers.

    Now have fun with Migget Chainsaw Hands!  But beware, the game gets harder with your 
    increasing score!
